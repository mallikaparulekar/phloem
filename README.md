Plex Hacks 2020 Project

Phloem is Phloem is a job searching tool that caters towards the user’s unique learning ability. After the user inputs their skills and dream job, we will find the skills that are missing and provide them with educational resources that will help fill in the gap. We especially hope to help those who may have lost their careers to automation or the COVID pandemic, including industries such as the food industry, transportation, manufacturing and hospitality

# How we built it/What we accomplished

In order to create Phloem, we used Python for the back end component and HTML/CSS for the front end component; we connected both aspects using Fast API. We called values from a database and created objects for each person. The program will look at the skills the user has, the skills the job requires and provide resources for any missing skills based on the user’s learning style.  When the user enters their user id, their profile will come up. When the user searches for a job, the job information will be shown.
